[GOAPPLE](https://github.com/Avdushin/GOAPPLE) is a small application for quickly setup the I3-WM window manager.
It helps acquaintance with I3-wm, and saves a lot of time thanks to ready-made configs.
The utility is written in Golang in conjunction with shell-scripts, which makes it fast and simple. Just "Keep It Simple, Stupid".
I hope with this program I will help you understand the I3-WM window manager.
